# Classic Game’s Quiz

The “Classic Game’s Quiz” website works as a simple quiz website where people can test their knowledge about games. The page starts with the “home page” (as I call it), which explains a little bit about the quiz and about what the visitor can expect of it. The start button contains the sentence “Ready…GO!” that I hear a lot when I’m playing my favorite Nintendo’s games. I’d like the user to feel that the quiz is also a game itself instead of just something to answer some questions. The design is very simple but functional.

I’m happy to submit this project the way it is as I had too much on my personal life that could have prevented me from doing it. I wish I could have more time to dedicate and do a better job, but I’ll continue my studies to reach that point.

## FEATURES

### Header
- The header only contains the name of the quiz.
- Its purpose is to show the visitor what it is about.
The stylization with the font “Pixelify Sans” is intentional to match the quiz theme.

### The start page
- The start page welcomes the visitor calling him/her a “player” to continue the feeling that the visitor is playing a game.
- It informs the content of the quiz and how many questions it has.
When the visitor is ready, he can click on “Ready… GO!” button which will take him/her to the first question.

### The Q&A
- The game has 10 questions, which one with 3 options to answer.
- The design is responsive and will adapt if the question or the answer is bigger.
- The colors match between each other and are readable on every question.

### The Game Results
- The results page will show how many questions the user got right. 
- In the “home page” the user is informed that there are 10 questions and the quiz also asks how many the user can guess right.
- I decided to write “Game Over” so the visitor can relate to an actual game.

### The footer
- The footer is simple and just inform the visitor that the website was created for educational purposes.

## TESTING

- I verified compatibility across different browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Edge.
- Confirmed responsiveness and functionality on various screen sizes using devtools.
- Ensured readability and clarity of all elements in the page.
- Verified the code and checked that the result is always correct.
- I had many problems with the JS code, which I tried my best to study and look for help to fix the problems.
- I started committing properly but then I think I got nervous with timing and forgot to commit simple changes which can negatively affect my code.

## BUGS
- Rectified issues identified by validators, such as rewriting the height values where I mistakenly wrote “height: 0 auto”, which makes no sense.
- Resolved all identified problems that I could.

### Validator Testing
 - **HTML:** Passed through the W3C validator with some errors.

## Unfixed bugs

### Html Validator
- I think it’s because of the space at the end of the lines but I’m not sure. Couldn’t understand the bugs in the html as I tried to fix but when I save the file, it all goes back to the previous state.
  
### JavaScript Validator
- I don’t know how to fix those bugs (how to make it available in other versions).

## CREDITS

### Content
- I had many issues trying to write the code so I rely on some content. I didn’t copied specific things but analyzed and studied their code.
