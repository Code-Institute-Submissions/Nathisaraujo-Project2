#Classic Game’s Quiz

The “Classic Game’s Quiz” website works as a simple quiz website where people can test their knowledge about games. The page starts with the “home page” (as I call it), which explains a little bit about the quiz and about what the visitor can expect of it. The start button contains the sentence “Ready…GO!” that I hear a lot when I’m playing my favorite Nintendo’s games. I’d like the user to feel that the quiz is also a game itself instead of just something to answer some questions. The design is very simple but functional.

I’m happy to submit this project the way it is as I had too much on my personal life that could have prevented me from doing it. I wish I could have more time to dedicate and do a better job, but I’ll continue my studies to reach that point.
